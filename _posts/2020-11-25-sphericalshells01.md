We study distributional solutions to the radially symmetric aggregation equation for power-law potentials. We show that distributions containing spherical shells form part of a basin of attraction in the space of solutions in the sense of “shifting stability." For spherical shell initial data, we prove the exponential convergence of solutions to equilibrium and construct some explicit solutions for specific ranges of attractive power. We further explore results concerning the evolution and equilibria for initial data formed from convex combinations of spherical shells.
