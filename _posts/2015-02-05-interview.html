A few days ago I was interviewed by <a href="http://ara.cat/">ara.cat</a> (a Catalan newspaper). You can read the interview in the following <a href="http://catalannetwork.ara.cat/2015/02/02/daniel-balague/" target="_blank">link</a>&nbsp;(it is in Catalan!) Unfortunately, Bing and Google do not do a good job translating from Catalan to English as they get the wrong verb tenses and the wrong pronouns, leading to misunderstandings and nonsense. If you mix the translations from both Bing and Google from Catalan to Spanish you can get the right tenses and the right meaning (in Spanish).<br /><br />If you are curious about Catalonia and Spain, you can read the English version of the newspaper in <a href="http://www.ara.cat/en" target="_blank">this link</a>.
